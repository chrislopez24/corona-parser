NOTE from Worldometers:
As of April 13, 2024, the Coronavirus Tracker is no longer being updated due to the unfeasibility of providing statistically valid global totals, as the majority of countries have now stopped reporting. Historical data remain accessible. Effective February 1, 2023, the Coronavirus Tracker had switched from LIVE to Daily Updates. As a number of major countries had transitioned to weekly updates, there was no need anymore for immediate updates throughout the day as soon as a new report is released.
On January 29, 2020, Worldometer started tracking the coronavirus, delivering the most accurate and timely global statistics to users and institutions around the world at a time when this was extremely challenging. We thank everyone who participated in this extraordinary collaborative effort.
